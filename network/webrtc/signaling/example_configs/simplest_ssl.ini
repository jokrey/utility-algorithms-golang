;TO GENERATE A NEW CERT (DO THAT A LOT IF YOU HAVE TO)
;EXECUTE: go run `go env GOROOT`/src/crypto/tls/generate_cert.go --ca=true --ecdsa-curve=P256 --host=<dns>
;Add the <dns>_cert.pem to the respective env (for example chrome, the flutter app, or whatever)
;   in flutter you need to add the .pem to the assets and import it using a wsclientable helper function
;You need a dns, ips appear to not work reliably.
;  In most routers it is possible to add a dns entry to the LAN ip of the server
