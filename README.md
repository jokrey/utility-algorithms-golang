# utility-algorithms-golang

My very own, multi purpose utility algorithms.
The algorithms and classes are all cool, but each not big enough for their own repository.

Some algorithms exist in a similar form in other repositories

Use this project by adding the following in your go.mod:

```
require (
  github.com/jokrey/utility-algorithms-golang v1.0.5
)
```
